### `What is Markdown?`

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as **bold** or _italic_, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

* Gists
* Comments in Issues and Pull * Requests
* Files with the .md or .markdown extension
